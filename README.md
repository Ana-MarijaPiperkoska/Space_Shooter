Space Shooter - is a game project that I created for learning purposes.
The Unity Version required for downloading this game project is - Unity 2022.3.40f1.

This project is deloped using Data-Oriented Technology Stack(DOTS) and it's optimised for perfomance by using Unity's Entity Component System (ECS), Burst Compiler, and Jobs system.

The project contains scripts for Player, Spawner and Enemy: Authoring and Movement containing the key features for - Simple movement, shooting and waves of enemies.

Gameplay:
The player uses the keyboard "WASD" keys to move around, and the "space" key for shooting at the enemies which are spawned randomly on the screen.
